abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega{\_}m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n{\_}s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68{\%} errors on measured parameters and 95{\%} limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N{\_} eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\textless} 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega{\_}K| {\textless} 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r {\textless}0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r {\textless} 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {The discrimination capabilities of a 70 g heat and ionization Ge bolometer are studied. This first prototype has been used by the EDELWEISS dark matter experiment, installed in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, for direct detection of WIMPs. Gamma and neutron calibrations demonstrate that this type of detector is able to reject more than 99.6{\%} of the background while retaining 95{\%} of the signal, provided that the background events distribution is not biased towards the surface of the Ge crystal. However, the 1.17 kgday of data taken in a relatively important radioactive environment show an extra population slightly overlapping the signal. This background is likely due to interactions of low energy photons or electrons near the surface of the crystal, and is somewhat reduced by applying a higher charge-collecting inverse bias voltage (-6 V instead of -2 V) to the Ge diode. Despite this contamination, more than 98{\%} of the background can be rejected while retaining 50{\%} of the signal. This yields a conservative upper limit of 0.7 eventday-1kg-1keVrecoil-1 at 90{\%} confidence level in the 15-45 keV recoil energy interval; the present sensitivity appears to be limited by the fast ambient neutrons. Upgrades in progress on the installation are summarized. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The experimental setup and the FID (Fully Inter-Digitized) detector array is described, as well as the efficiency of the double measurement of heat and ionization signals in background rejection. For the whole set of 24 FID detectors used for coincidence studies, the baseline resolutions for the fiducial ionization energy are mainly below 0.7 keV{\$}{\_}{\{}ee{\}}{\$} (FHWM) whereas the baseline resolutions for heat energies are mainly below 1.5 keV{\$}{\_}{\{}ee{\}}{\$} (FWHM).

abstract = {The problems dealt with concern the production of electron‐hole pairs in a semiconductor exposed to high‐energy radiation. The goal is to develop a simple phenomenological model capable of describing the present experimental situation from the standpoint of yield, variance, and bandgap dependence. We proceed on the premise that $\epsilon$, the average amount of radiation energy consumed per pair, can be accounted for by a sum of three contributions: the intrinsic bandgap (EG ), optical phonon losses r(ℏ$\omega$R ), and the residual kinetic energy (9/5) EG . The approach differs from prior treatments in the sense that the residual kinetic energy relates to a threshold for impact ionization taken to be 3 2 E G in accordance with indications stemming from studies of avalanching in p‐n junctions. This model is subjected to three quantitative tests: (a) Fano‐factor variations are found to reflect the relative weight of phonon losses [K=r(ℏ$\omega$R )/EG ], but residual energy fluctuations govern the statistical behavior for K 2 ≲0.3 . An application to Ge yields good agreement with the best measurements available (F=0.13±0.02 at 77°K). (b) The bandgap dependence of pair‐creation energies conforms to the model [$\epsilon$= (14/5) EG +r(ℏ$\omega$R )] and suggests that optical phonon losses remain essentially constant [0.5≤r(ℏ$\omega$R )≤1.0 eV]. This would imply that the mean‐free‐path ratio for pair production and phonon emission (r=$\lambda$̄ I /$\lambda$ R ) is of the order of 10 or 20 for most semiconductors. (c) A detailed assessment of the situation in Si leads to the conclusion that, in this material, $\lambda$̄ I is approx 400 {\AA}. The figure accords, roughly, with inferences made from the spectral distribution of hot electrons emitted by shallow junctions and thus points to ``average{\&}apos;{\&}apos; impacts occurring at about 5 eV; by the same token, it substantiates the conception of pairs originating either through plasmon decay or in the final stages of a branching process.},

abstract = {A dedicated analysis of the muon-induced background in the EDELWEISS dark matter search has been performed on a data set acquired in 2009 and 2010. The total muon flux underground in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) was measured to be $\Phi$$\mu$=(5.4±0.2-0.9+0.5) muons/m 2/d. The modular design of the $\mu$-veto system allows the reconstruction of the muon trajectory and hence the determination of the angular dependent muon flux in LSM. The results are in good agreement with both MC simulations and earlier measurements. Synchronization of the $\mu$-veto system with the phonon and ionization signals of the Ge detector array allowed identification of muon-induced events. Rates for all muon-induced events $\Gamma$$\mu$=(0.172±0.012)evts/(kgd) and of WIMP-like events $\Gamma$$\mu$-n=0.008-0.004+0.005evts/(kgd) were extracted.

Based on these results, the muon-induced background expectation for an anticipated exposure of 3000 kg d for EDELWEISS-III is N3000kgd$\mu$-n{\textless}0.6 events. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The EDELWEISS-II collaboration has completed a direct search for WIMP dark matter using cryogenic Ge detectors (400 g each) and 384 kg ?? days of effective exposure. A cross-section of 4.4??10-8 pb is excluded at 90{\%} C. L. for a WIMP mass of 85 GeV. The next phase, EDELWEISS-III, aims to probe spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-sections down to a few ??10 -9 pb. We present here the study of gamma and neutron background coming from radioactive decays in the set-up and shielding materials. We have carried out Monte Carlo simulations for the completed EDELWEISS-II setup with GEANT4 and normalised the expected background rates to the measured radioactivity levels (or their upper limits) of all materials and components. The expected gamma-ray event rate in EDELWEISS-II at 20-200 keV agrees with the observed rate of 82 events/kg/day within the uncertainties in the measured concentrations. The calculated neutron rate from radioactivity of 1.0-3.1 events (90{\%} C. L.) at 20-200 keV in the EDELWEISS-II data together with the expected upper limit on the misidentified gamma-ray events (???0.9), surface betas (???0.3), and muon-induced neutrons (???0.7), do not contradict five observed events in nuclear recoil band. We have then extended the simulation framework to the EDELWEISS-III configuration with 800 g crystals, better material purity and additional neutron shielding inside the cryostat. The gamma-ray and neutron backgrounds in 24 kg fiducial mass of EDELWEISS-III have been calculated as 14-44 events/kg/day and 0.7-1.4 events per year, respectively. The results of the background studies performed in the present work have helped to select better purity components and improve shielding in EDELWEISS-III to further reduce the expected rate of background events in the next phase of the experiment. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents our interpretation and understanding of the different backgrounds in the EDELWEISS-I data sets. We analyze in detail the several populations observed, which include gammas, alphas, neutrons, thermal sensor events and surface events, and try to combine all data sets to provide a coherent picture of the nature and localization of the background sources. In light of this interpretation, we draw conclusions regarding the background suppression scheme for the EDELWEISS-II phase. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ROOT system in an Object Oriented framework for large scale data analysis. ROOT written in C++, contains, among others, an efficient hierarchical OO database, a C++ interpreter, advanced statistical analysis (multi-dimensional histogramming, fitting, minimization, cluster finding algorithms) and visualization tools. The user interacts with ROOT via a graphical user interface, the command line or batch scripts. The command and scripting language is C++ (using the interpreter) and large scripts can be compiled and dynamically linked in. The OO database design has been optimized for parallel access (reading as well as writing) by multiple processes.},

abstract = {A multi-tiered data structure, analysis toolkit and data processing management system has been constructed using ROOT and CouchDB. This system is well suited for experiments that acquire many computer files of raw data over the course of months or years, that are distributed to different computing centers and further reduced in size by several steps of data processing. Data handling for experiments searching for rare events extracted from digitized pulse traces typically fit this description. An implementation of this system has been constructed for the EDELWEISS-III experiment and is described here in some detail. This solution may also serve as a prototype system for the proposed EURECA experiment.  2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
